Most of the results are based, first, on an a priori design of functionals and, finally, on the use of the famous Jensen's inequality. In contrast with this design process, the present paper aims at providing a generic set of integral inequalities which are asymptotically non conservative and then to design functionals driven by these inequalities. The resulting stability conditions form a hierarchy of LMI which is competitive with the most efficient existing methods (delay-partitioning, discretization and sum of squares), in terms of conservatism and of complexity. Finally, some examples show the efficiency of the method.},

  abstract        = {The focus of this study is the performance of high-density truck platooning achieved with different wireless technologies for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Platooning brings advantages such as lower fuel consumption and better traffic efficiency, which are maximized when the inter-vehicle spacing can be steadily maintained at a feasible minimum. This can be achieved with Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control, an automated cruise controller that relies on the complex interplay among V2V communications, on-board sensing, and actuation. This work provides a clear mapping between the performance of the V2V communications, which is measured in terms of latency and reliability, and of the platoon, which is measured in terms of achievable inter-truck spacing. Two families of radio technologies are compared: IEEE 802.11p and 3GPP Cellular-V2X (C-V2X). The C-V2X technology considered in this work is based on the Release 14 of the LTE standard, which includes two modes for V2V communications: Mode 3 (base-station-scheduled) and Mode 4 (autonomously-scheduled). Results show that C-V2X in both modes allows for shorter inter-truck distances than IEEE 802.11p due to more reliable communications performance under increasing congestion on the wireless channel caused by surrounding vehicles.},

  abstract        = {Obtaining an optimal stability condition is very important to benefit traffic flow operations for a mix of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and regular vehicles. In view of multiple spatial anticipations of CAV car-following models, this paper presents a stability analysis method for mixed CAV flow from the perspective of the uniform local platoon. Transfer function theory was used to derive the stability criterion of the uniform local platoon, based on which a stability chart of equilibrium speeds and CAV feedback coefficients was calculated. Numerical simulations were also performed on a segment of highway with an on-ramp using car-following models to evaluate the impacts of the stability analysis on fuel consumption and emissions [carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxides (NOX)]. The stability chart indicates that by controlling CAV feedback coefficients, the optimal stability condition can be obtained, in which the uniform local platoon remains stable for all driving speeds. Moreover, the stability analysis method can reduce fuel consumption and traffic emissions. DOI: 10.1061/JTEPBS.0000196. {\textcopyright} 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

  abstract        = {A novel strategy to enhance string stability of autonomous vehicles with sensor delay and actuator lag is proposed based on a model predictive control framework. To compensate sensor delay, the approach entails estimating the (unknown) system state at the current time using the system state in a previous time, the applied control history and a system dynamics model. The actuator lag is compensated by including the lag in the state prediction model. The mathematical framework shows that without the anticipation strategy, sensor delay leads to a worse estimate of the initial condition for the optimal control problem and actuator lag increases the mismatch between the system state prediction model and the actual system behaviour. Simulation verified that sensor delay and actuator lag degrade string stability of platoons. The proposed anticipatory control strategy shows clear benefits in improving autonomous vehicle string stability and hence has potential to enhance traffic flow stability.},

  abstract        = {Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) provides significant traffic flow improvements when a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication link exists with the preceding vehicle, but it degrades to an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) when this communication link is no longer available. This degradation occurs even if the information from another V2V-equipped vehicle ahead (different to the preceding one) is still available. This paper presents a novel car-following control system–Advanced Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (ACACC)–that benefits from the existing communication with this vehicle ahead in the string, reducing inter-vehicle gap whereas keeping string stability. The proposed control structure provides a hybrid behaviour between two CACC controllers with different time gaps according to the string position of the vehicle with the V2V communication link available. An stable hybrid behavior between both controllers is ensured through the Youla-Kucera parameterization. Simulation and real experiments show the proper behaviour of the designed control algorithm and a good performance compared to existing ACC/CACC controllers.},

  abstract        = {To improve the safety and the efficiency of vehicle merge at freeway ramp and reduce the fuel consumption, an optimal longitudinal trajectory planning method for multiple connected and automated vehicles facing freeway ramp was proposed to realize the vehicle cooperative merge. First, the vehicle longitudinal dynamics model was established, and the cost function of energy efficiency and ride comfort was considered to construct the optimal vehicle speed control problem on the on-ramp. Based on the first-in, first-out(FIFO) merging sequence, the time and the time interval of each adjacent vehicle arriving at merging point were designed to realize safe and efficient cooperative merge. The optimal vehicle speed control problem was solved by using Pontryagin's minimum principle, and the optimal analytical solution of each vehicle longitudinal speed was derived. The simulation results show that compared with uncontrolled natural merge, the traffic time and the fuel consumption of the proposed control method are reduced by 41.64% and 12.25%, respectively. Compared with the existing control method based on virtual queue, the traffic efficiency difference is 1.67% and the fuel consumption is reduced by 4.52%.},

  abstract        = {The presence of (partially) automated vehicles on the roads presents an opportunity to compensate the unstable behavior of conventional vehicles. Vehicles subject to perturbations should: 1) recover their equilibrium speed and 2) react not to propagate but absorb perturbations. In this paper, we start with considering vehicle systems consisting of heterogeneous vehicles updating their dynamics according to realistic behavioral car-following models. Definitions of all types of stability that are of interest in the vehicle system, namely, input-output stability, scalability, weak and strict string stability, are introduced based on recent studies. Then, frequency domain linear stability analyses are conducted after linearization of the modeled system of vehicles, leading to conditions for input-output stability, strict and weak string stability over the behavioral parameters of the system, for finite and infinite systems of homogeneous and heterogeneous vehicles. This provides a solid basis that was missing for car-following model-based control design in mixed traffic systems where only a proportion of vehicles can be controlled. After visualization of the theoretical results in simulation, we formulate an optimization strategy with linear matrix inequality constraints to tune the behavioral parameters of the automated vehicles in order to maximize the L $\infty$ string stability of the mixed traffic flow while considering the comfort of automated driving. The optimization strategy systematically leads to increased traffic flow stability. We show that very few automated vehicles are required to prevent the propagation of realistic disturbances.},

  abstract = {Urged by a close future perspective of a traffic flow made of a mix of human-driven vehicles and connected, automated vehicles (CAVs), research has recently focused at making the most of CAVs capabilities to mitigate the instability of the whole, i.e. mixed, traffic flow. In all works, however, either the two sub-flows are studied under a simplifying but unrealistic assumption of flow homogeneity, or drivers’ and vehicles heterogeneity is not correctly taken into account within each sub-flow. We show here that the only condition developed so far to study a car-following model string stability for a heterogeneous flow, is inaccurate. Therefore, we propose a methodology to model string stability that considers drivers’ and vehicles heterogeneity, which is the essence of a real traffic. Uncertain transfer functions are introduced to map the probability distributions of car-following model parameters into a L2 stability measure of a mixed and heterogeneous traffic. Specifically, they allow us to move from the stability analysis of a car-following model, or of a controller, to the stability analysis of a traffic flow, as interpreted by that model, or controller. Eventually, several other theoretical contributions on stability analysis are given in the paper, aiming at reconciling approaches from different fields.

  abstract = {In this paper, a serial distributed model predictive control (MPC) approach for connected automated vehicles (CAVS) is developed with local stability (disturbance dissipation over time) and multi-criteria string stability (disturbance attenuation through a vehicular string). Two string stability criteria are considered within the proposed MPC: (i) the l∞-norm string stability criterion for attenuation of the maximum disturbance magnitude and (ii) l2-norm string stability criterion for attenuation of disturbance energy. The l∞-norm string stability is achieved by formulating constraints within the MPC based on the future states of the leading CAV, and the l2-norm string stability is achieved by proper weight matrix tuning over a robust positive invariant set. For rigor, mathematical proofs for asymptotical local stability and multi-criteria string stability are provided. Simulation experiments verify that the distributed serial MPC proposed in this study is effective for disturbance attenuation and performs better than traditional MPC without stability guarantee.},

  abstract = {Literature has shown potentials of Connected/Cooperative Automated Vehicles (CAVs) in improving highway operations, especially on roadway capacity and flow stability. However, benefits were also shown to be negligible at low market penetration rates. This work develops a novel adaptive driving strategy for CAVs to stabilise heterogeneous vehicle strings by controlling one CAV under vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. Assumed is a roadside system with V2I communications, which receives control parameters of the CAV in the string and estimates parameters imperfectly of non-connected automated vehicles. It determines the adaptive control parameters (e.g. desired time gap and feedback gains) of the CAV if a downstream disturbance is identified and sends them to the CAV. The CAV changes its behaviour based on the adaptive parameters commanded by the roadside system to suppress the disturbance. The proposed adaptive driving strategy is based on string stability analysis of heterogeneous vehicle strings. To this end, linearised vehicle dynamics model and control law are used in the controller parametrisation and Laplace transform of the speed and gap error dynamics in time domain to frequency domain enables the determination of sufficient string stability criteria of heterogeneous strings. The analytical string stability conditions give new insights into automated vehicular string stability properties in relation to the system properties of time delays and controller design parameters of feedback gains and desired time gap. It further allows the quantification of a stability margin, which is subsequently used to adapt the feedback control gains and desired time gap of the CAV to suppress the amplification of gap and speed errors through the string. Analytical results are verified via systematic simulation of both homogeneous and heterogeneous strings. Simulation demonstrates the predictive power of the analytical string stability conditions. The performance of the adaptive driving strategy under V2I cooperation is tested in simulation. Results show that even the estimation of control parameters of non-connected automated vehicles are imperfect and there is mismatch between the model used in analytical derivation and that in simulation, the proposed adaptive driving strategy suppresses disturbances in a wide range of situations.},

  abstract  = {The incorporation of a macroscopic approach reflecting Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) traffic dynamics in a gas-kinetic (GKT) traffic flow model is presented. The approach is a novel one and is based on the introduction of a relaxation term that satisfies the time/space-gap principle of ACC or CACC systems. The relaxation time is assigned on multiple leading vehicles in the CACC case, whereas in the ACC case this relaxation time is only assigned to the direct leading vehicle. Numerical simulations investigate the effect of ACC and CACC to traffic flow macroscopic stability with respect to perturbations introduced in a ring road and to flow characteristics in open freeways with merging flows at an on-ramp. Following from the results, it can be deduced that CACC vehicles increase the stabilization of traffic flow, compared to ACC ones. Further, the proposed CACC approach can further improve the dynamic equilibrium capacity and traffic dynamics, especially at on-ramp bottlenecks.},

  abstract = {Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have great potential to improve road transportation systems. Most existing strategies for CAVs' longitudinal control focus on downstream traffic conditions, but neglect the impact of CAVs' behaviors on upstream traffic flow. In this paper, we introduce a notion of Leading Cruise Control (LCC), in which the CAV maintains car-following operations adapting to the states of its preceding vehicles, and also aims to lead the motion of its following vehicles. Specifically, by controlling the CAV, LCC aims to attenuate downstream traffic perturbations and smooth upstream traffic flow actively. We first present the dynamical modeling of LCC, with a focus on three fundamental scenarios: car-following, free-driving, and Connected Cruise Control. Then, the analysis of controllability, observability, and head-to-tail string stability reveals the feasibility and potential of LCC in improving mixed traffic flow performance. Extensive numerical studies validate that the capability of CAVs in dissipating traffic perturbations is further strengthened when incorporating the information of the vehicles behind into the CAVs' control.},
