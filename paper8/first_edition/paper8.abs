Driven by the potential of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), recent research has focused on exploring their benefits on safety, emissions and capability. However, CAVs have been isolated in most research, and in-depth investigations of stability conditions are lacking. Thus, this paper proposes a generic modeling approach for heterogeneous CAV platoon considering time-varying communication delay. Moreover, a novel stability condition of the generic heterogeneous CAV platoon with less conservatism is derived from applying Wirtinger-Based Integral Inequality and Lyapunov-Krasovskii Stability Theorem. Furthermore, extensive numerical analyses in a variety of scenarios are conducted to comprehensively evaluate the tracking performance and safety conditions of four typical IFTs and thus provide guidance for the selection of Information flow topologies (IFTs). The results indicate that all CAVs under each IFT have smooth tracking performance if stability is guaranteed. In addition, Leader-based IFTs can enable smoother tracking performance and safer driving conditions compared to other IFTs. And employing bi-directional communication ensures superior tracking performance despite the long CAV platoon, while uni-directional communication does not.
