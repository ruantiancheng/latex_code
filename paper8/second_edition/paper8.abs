Driven by the potential of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), recent research has focused on their benefits on safety, emissions, and capability. These benefits are preconditioned on the satisfaction of stability, the primary goal of CAVs. However, due to the unavoidable communication delay, stability cannot be absolutely guaranteed by the widely adopted feedback control. Therefore, numerous research has been conducted to derive stability conditions considering communication delay. However, limited by the adopted methodology, most of the research implicitly assumes that the communication delay is set as a constant representing the maximum communication delay. The fact is that communication delay is time-varying according to the variation of the surrounding environment. In general, there is a lack of a method for deriving the stability conditions considering the time-varying delay. Therefore, to address this problem, this paper first proposes a generic supermatrix modeling approach for the CAV platoon considering time-varying communication delay. Moreover, a novel stability condition considering the time-varying delay of the generic CAV platoon is derived by applying Wirtinger-Based Integral Inequality and the Lyapunov-Krasovskii Stability Theorem. Furthermore, extensive numerical analyses in various scenarios are conducted to comprehensively evaluate the tracking performance and safety conditions of different control parameters and information flow topologies (IFTs) and thus shed some light. The results indicate that all CAVs under different control parameters and IFTs have smooth tracking performance if stability is guaranteed. In addition, increasing the gain of spacing and velocity errors can benefit tracking performance and safety conditions, while increasing the gain of acceleration errors does not. Moreover, Leader-based and bi-directional communication enables superior tracking and transient performance.
