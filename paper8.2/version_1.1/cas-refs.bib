  abstract        = {A novel strategy to enhance string stability of autonomous vehicles with sensor delay and actuator lag is proposed based on a model predictive control framework. To compensate sensor delay, the approach entails estimating the (unknown) system state at the current time using the system state in a previous time, the applied control history and a system dynamics model. The actuator lag is compensated by including the lag in the state prediction model. The mathematical framework shows that without the anticipation strategy, sensor delay leads to a worse estimate of the initial condition for the optimal control problem and actuator lag increases the mismatch between the system state prediction model and the actual system behaviour. Simulation verified that sensor delay and actuator lag degrade string stability of platoons. The proposed anticipatory control strategy shows clear benefits in improving autonomous vehicle string stability and hence has potential to enhance traffic flow stability.},

abstract = {In this paper large connected vehicle systems are analyzed where vehicles utilize vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to control their longitudinal motion. It is shown that packet drops in communication channels introduce stochastic delay variations in the feedback loops. Scalable methods are developed to evaluate stability and disturbance attenuation while utilizing the mean, second moment, and covariance dynamics in open chain and closed ring configurations. The stability results are summarized using stability diagrams in the plane of the control parameters while varying the packet delivery ratio and the number of vehicles. Also, the relationship between the stability of different configurations is characterized. The results emphasize the feasibility of V2V communication-based control in improving traffic flow.}

abstract = {This paper presents a discrete control framework for a homogeneous vehicle platoon, which can minimize the energy consumption of each vehicle while ensuring the platoon string stability under external interference and communication delay. First, a novel variable spacing strategy named as the energy-oriented spacing policy is proposed by comparing the geometry relationship of each vehicle which drives at energy-optimal speed and the ideal speed under the constant spacing policy. Then, based on the energy-oriented spacing policy, the dynamics of a homogeneous discrete vehicle platoon composed of several pure electric vehicles are built, including the communication delay and external disturbance. Second, a discrete robust platoon controller that can reduce the conservatism of the control system is designed based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theorem and H∞ method, which drives each vehicle at their energy-optimal speed while ensuring the string stability of platoon under communication delays and interferences. Third, the L2-based string stability of the discrete platoon is defined, and its string-stable criterion is given under communication delays and external disturbances. Simulation results indicate that the proposed energy-oriented spacing policy and the discrete controller can enable efficient driving of each vehicle while ensuring the platoon string stability. The energy consumption of the whole platoon is, respectively, reduced by 7.3% and 5.7% compared to the vehicle platoon controllers with constant spacing policy and constant time headway policy.}

To actuate platooning in a safe way it is necessary to design controllers able to effectively operate on informations exchanged via Inter-Vehicular Communication (IVC) systems despite the presence of unavoidable communication impairments, such as multiple time-varying delays that affect communication links. To this aim in this paper we propose a novel distributed adaptive collaborative control strategy that exploits information coming from connected vehicles to achieve leader synchronization and we analytically demonstrate its stability with a Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is shown via numerical simulations in Plexe, a state of the art IVC and mobility simulator that includes basic building blocks for platooning.}

abstract = {In car-following models, the driver reacts according to his physical and psychological abilities which may change over time. However, most car-following models are deterministic and do not capture the stochastic nature of human perception. It is expected that purely deterministic traffic models may produce unrealistic results due to the stochastic driving behaviors of drivers. This paper is devoted to the development of a distinct car-following model where a stochastic process is adopted to describe the time-varying random acceleration which essentially reflects the random individual perception of driver behavior with respect to the leading vehicle over time. In particular, we apply coupled Langevin equations to model complex human driver behavior. In the proposed model, an extended Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) stochastic process will be used to describe the stochastic speed of the follower in response to the stimulus of the leader. An important property of the extended CIR process is to enhance the non-negative properties of the stochastic traffic variables (e.g. non-negative speed) for any arbitrary model parameters. Based on stochastic process theories, we derive stochastic linear stability conditions which, for the first time, theoretically capture the effect of the random parameter on traffic instabilities. Our stability results conform to the empirical results that the traffic instability is related to the stochastic nature of traffic flow at the low speed conditions, even when traffic is deemed to be stable from deterministic models.}

abstract = {In this paper, the stabilization strategies of a general nonlinear car-following model with reaction-time delay of the drivers are investigated. The reaction-time delay of the driver is time varying and bounded. By using the Lyapunov stability theory, the sufficient condition for the existence of the state feedback control strategy for the stability of the car-following model is given in the form of linear matrix inequality, under which the traffic jam can be well suppressed with respect to the varying reaction-time delay. Moreover, by considering the external disturbance for the running cars, the robust state feedback control strategy is designed, which ensures robust stability and a smaller prescribed H∞ disturbance attenuation level for the traffic flow. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.}
