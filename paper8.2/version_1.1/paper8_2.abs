In recent years, Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Controls (CACCs) have gradually become a promising solution to problems such as traffic congestion and pollutant emissions, with significant research supporting their effectiveness. This is all based on meeting the fundamental control objective of stability. However, widely used feedback control cannot guarantee absolute stability due to the inevitable presence of communication delays. As a result, numerous research efforts have been conducted to derive stability conditions that consider communication delays. However, the time-varying and rate-free attributes of communication delay make deriving stability conditions highly challenging. Therefore, this paper establishes a general representation for a CACC platoon considering a rate-free communication delay. Building upon this representation, a novel stability condition for a CACC platoon considering a rate-free communication delay is derived using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii Stability Theorem and Schur complement to address the rate-free attribute. Furthermore, another robust stability condition is deduced, considering the presence of measurement uncertainties. Additionally, extensive numerical analyses are conducted to investigate the impact of a rate-free communication delay and measurement uncertainties on tracking performance, transient response, and safety conditions. The results indicate that all CACCs can effectively track errors and achieve equilibrium if the stability condition is fulfilled. Furthermore, realistic scenarios with a rate-free communication delay and measurement uncertainties exhibit poorer tracking performance, transient response, and safety conditions than ideal scenarios featuring constant communication delay. Also, CACCs with access to more distant and diverse information demonstrate superior transient response and safety conditions.
