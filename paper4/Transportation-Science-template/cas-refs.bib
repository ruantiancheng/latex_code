Especially vehicle platoons have been intensively investigated. An interesting problem that arises in this area is string stability, which broadly speaking means that an input signal amplifies unboundedly as it travels through the vehicle string. However, various, not necessarily equivalent, definitions are commonly used. In this paper, we aim to formalise the notion of string stability and illustrate the importance of those distinctions on simulation examples. A second goal is to extend the definitions to general networked systems.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we consider a Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) system, which regulates intervehicle distances in a vehicle string, for achieving improved traffic flow stability and throughput. Improved performance can be achieved by utilizing information exchange between vehicles through wireless communication in addition to local sensor measurements. However, wireless communication introduces network-induced imperfections, such as transmission delays, due to the limited bandwidth of the network and the fact that multiple nodes are sharing the same medium. Therefore, we approach the design of a CACC system from a Networked Control System (NCS) perspective and present an NCS modeling framework that incorporates the effect of sampling, hold, and network delays that occur due to wireless communication and sampled-data implementation of the CACC controller over this wireless link. Based on this network-aware modeling approach, we develop a technique to study the so-called string stability property of the string, in which vehicles are interconnected by a vehicle following control law and a constant time headway spacing policy. This analysis technique can be used to investigate tradeoffs between CACC performance (string stability) and network specifications (such as delays), which are essential in the multidisciplinary design of CACC controllers. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of the presented framework in practice by experiments performed with CACC-equipped prototype vehicles. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

  abstract   = {This paper is concerned with the control of highly uncertain systems. A formal theoretical explanation of the model-mismatch instability problem often associated with adaptive control design schemes is proposed, and a generic solution is provided. A primary task of adaptive control is formulated as ﬁnding an asymptotically optimal, stabilizing controller, given the feasibility of adaptive control problem. Feasibility is deﬁned as the existence of a stabilizing solution in a continuously parametrized candidate controller set. The multi-faceted adaptive control problem is thus placed in a setting of a standard optimization problem. The proposed solution, called safe adaptive control, robustly achieves this goal without any assumptions other than feasibility. Speciﬁcally, a list of the required plant-independent properties of the cost function is formulated. The result extends previous theoretical results in hysteresis switching control established in the past decade, and provides a signiﬁcant generalization by allowing the class of candidate controllers to have arbitrary cardinality, structure or dimensionality, and by strengthening the concept of tunability. The problem is motivated by a model-mismatch stability failure associated with a multitude of adaptive control schemes, exempliﬁed by several simulation results. These examples demonstrate that existing adaptive schemes suffer from a wrong ordering of the controllers, and thus potential hazard of even latching onto destabilizing ones. Particular attention is drawn by the examples of previously stable open loops, which become unstable when closed in feedback with the adaptive controller whose ordering lacks the properties established herein.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a discrete control framework for a homogeneous vehicle platoon, which can minimize the energy consumption of each vehicle while ensuring the platoon string stability under external interference and communication delay. First, a novel variable spacing strategy named as the energy-oriented spacing policy is proposed by comparing the geometry relationship of each vehicle which drives at energy-optimal speed and the ideal speed under the constant spacing policy. Then, based on the energy-oriented spacing policy, the dynamics of a homogeneous discrete vehicle platoon composed of several pure electric vehicles are built, including the communication delay and external disturbance. Second, a discrete robust platoon controller that can reduce the conservatism of the control system is designed based on the LyapunovKrasovskii theorem and H method, which drives each vehicle at their energy-optimal speed while ensuring the string stability of platoon under communication delays and interferences. Third, the L2-based string stability of the discrete platoon is defined, and its string-stable criterion is given under communication delays and external disturbances. Simulation results indicate that the proposed energy-oriented spacing policy and the discrete controller can enable efficient driving of each vehicle while ensuring the platoon string stability. The energy consumption of the whole platoon is, respectively, reduced by 7.3\% and 5.7\% compared to the vehicle platoon controllers with constant spacing policy and constant time headway policy.},

  abstract  = {This paper develops distributed optimization based, platoon centered CAV car following schemes, motivated by the recent interest in CAV platooning technologies. Various distributed optimization or control schemes have been developed for CAV platooning. However, most existing distributed schemes for platoon centered CAV control require either centralized data processing or centralized computation in at least one step of their schemes, referred to as partially distributed schemes. In this paper, we develop fully distributed optimization based, platoon centered CAV platooning control under the linear vehicle dynamics via the model predictive control approach with a general prediction horizon. These fully distributed schemes do not require centralized data processing or centralized computation through the entire schemes. To develop these schemes, we propose a new formulation of the objective function and a decomposition method that decomposes a densely coupled central objective function into the sum of several locally coupled functions whose coupling satisﬁes the network topology constraint. We then exploit the formulation of locally coupled optimization and operator splitting methods to develop fully distributed schemes. Control design and stability analysis is carried out to achieve desired traﬃc transient performance and asymptotic stability. Numerical tests demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed fully distributed schemes and CAV platooning control.},

  abstract = {In real-world driving environments, a platoon of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will be subject to many disturbances (e.g., aerodynamic drag, dynamic road gradients) that can prevent them from achieving desired control accurately. These disturbances can cause in the vehicle dynamics, reducing platoon safety and mobility. To address this , this study proposes a robust cooperative control (RCC) strategy, developed as a minimax problem, to ensure the safe and efficient maneuvering of a CAV platoon in the worst-case  due to uncertainties in the vehicle dynamics. The maximization subproblem of the minimax problem determines the inputs of the uncertainties to maximize the cost function (i.e., the platoon performance indicator), while the minimization subproblem seeks to optimize the control  for all following vehicles in the platoon to minimize the cost function using inputs of the uncertainties from the maximization subproblem. A novel partition-based method of feasible direction is proposed to solve the minimax problem. It is globally convergent and computationally efficient, enabling the RCC strategy to be deployed in real time. The conditions for robust stability of the CAV platoon are also analyzed. Results from numerical studies show that compared to a control strategy that ignores uncertainties in vehicle dynamics, the RCC strategy can substantially improve the platoon performance under disturbances. Hence, it can be used to enable the safe and efficient maneuvering of CAV platoons in a real-world driving environment.},

This paper proposes a generalized framework of the Lighthill-WhithamRichards (LWR) model for such mixed vehicular ﬂow under different CACC penetration rates. In this approach, the kinematic wave speed propagating through the mixed platoon was theoretically proven to be the slope of mixed fundamental diagram. In addition, the random degradation from CACC to ACC was captured in mathematical expectation for trafﬁc scenarios where the CACC only monitors one vehicle ahead. Three concrete carfollowing models, the intelligent driver model (IDM) and CACC/ACC models validated by Partners for Advanced Transit and Highways (PATH) program, were selected as examples to investigate the propagation of small perturbations and shock waves. Numerical simulations were also performed based on the selected car-following models. Moreover, the derived mixed LWR model was applied to solve some trafﬁc ﬂow problems. It indicates that the proposed LWR model is able to describe the propagation properties of both small perturbations and shock waves. The mixed LWR model can also be used to solve some practical problems, such as the queue caused by a trafﬁc accident and the impact of a moving bottleneck. More importantly, the proposed generalized framework admits other CACC/ACC/ regular car-following models, including those developed from further experiments.},

  abstract = {Adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles are proving to be the first generation of automated vehicles. Although many studies have found that, theoretically, ACC vehicles may have positive impacts on traffic string stability and throughput, recent studies reveal that commercially-available ACC vehicles are string unstable. However, it is still not clear what impacts on highway traffic these commercially-available ACC vehicles may have at higher market penetration rates. Therefore, the objective of this study is twofold: (i) investigate the impacts on highway traffic capacity of mixed human-piloted vehicles and theoretical ACC vehicles as well as commercially-available ACC vehicles at different market penetration rates; (ii) explore the potential relationship between string stability and highway throughput. We use the intelligent driver model with calibrated parameter values from car following data collected on commercially-available ACC vehicles and compare the simulation results to simulations conducted using a theoretical ACC vehicle model with parameter values obtained in the literature. The results show that when simulating ACC vehicles found in the literature,traffic flow is string stable and the bottleneck capacity increases by up to 7\% at higher market penetration rates as compared to homogeneous human driven traffic. When commercially-available ACC vehicles are simulated, the traffic flow is string unstable and the bottleneck capacity decreases at higher market penetration rates with some scenarios resulting in a decrease in capacity of up to 35\%. The analysis provides evidence that bottleneck capacity is substantially affected by string stability and inter-vehicle time gap, while downstream throughput is solely influenced by time gap.},

  abstract = {Urged by a close future perspective of a traffic flow made of a mix of human-driven vehicles and connected, automated vehicles (CAVs), research has recently focused at making the most of CAVs capabilities to mitigate the instability of the whole, i.e. mixed, traffic flow. In all works, however, either the two sub-flows are studied under a simplifying but unrealistic assumption of flow homogeneity, or drivers’ and vehicles heterogeneity is not correctly taken into account within each sub-flow. We show here that the only condition developed so far to study a car-following model string stability for a heterogeneous flow, is inaccurate. Therefore, we propose a methodology to model string stability that considers drivers’ and vehicles heterogeneity, which is the essence of a real traffic. Uncertain transfer functions are introduced to map the probability distributions of car-following model parameters into a L2 stability measure of a mixed and heterogeneous traffic. Specifically, they allow us to move from the stability analysis of a car-following model, or of a controller, to the stability analysis of a traffic flow, as interpreted by that model, or controller. Eventually, several other theoretical contributions on stability analysis are given in the paper, aiming at reconciling approaches from different fields. Among these, a mathematical justification of the equivalence between the asymptotic stability of a closed-loop platoon system – which has been studied through the famous “traffic wave ansatz” on a ring-road – and the L2 stability of an open-loop platoon system.},
