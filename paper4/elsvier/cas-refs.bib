  abstract        = {Networked systems and their control are highly important and appear in a variety of applications, including vehicle platooning and formation control. Especially vehicle platoons have been intensively investigated. An interesting problem that arises in this area is string stability, which broadly speaking means that an input signal amplifies unboundedly as it travels through the vehicle string. However, various, not necessarily equivalent, definitions are commonly used. In this paper, we aim to formalise the notion of string stability and illustrate the importance of those distinctions on simulation examples. A second goal is to extend the definitions to general networked systems.},

@article{Oncu2014,
  abstract  = {In this paper, we consider a Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) system, which regulates intervehicle distances in a vehicle string, for achieving improved traffic flow stability and throughput. Improved performance can be achieved by utilizing information exchange between vehicles through wireless communication in addition to local sensor measurements. However, wireless communication introduces network-induced imperfections, such as transmission delays, due to the limited bandwidth of the network and the fact that multiple nodes are sharing the same medium. Therefore, we approach the design of a CACC system from a Networked Control System (NCS) perspective and present an NCS modeling framework that incorporates the effect of sampling, hold, and network delays that occur due to wireless communication and sampled-data implementation of the CACC controller over this wireless link. Based on this network-aware modeling approach, we develop a technique to study the so-called string stability property of the string, in which vehicles are interconnected by a vehicle following control law and a constant time headway spacing policy. This analysis technique can be used to investigate tradeoffs between CACC performance (string stability) and network specifications (such as delays), which are essential in the multidisciplinary design of CACC controllers. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of the presented framework in practice by experiments performed with CACC-equipped prototype vehicles. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},
