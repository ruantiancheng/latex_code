With the development of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) technology, CACC Market Penetration Rate (MPR) is expected to increase rapidly in the near future, which will result in more CACC platoons. Controller design seeking strict string stability is unable to take full advantage of CACC platoons which can maintain head-to-tail stability with a smaller desired time gap. This paper first proposed a novel CACC controller design mode— Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Platoon Control (CACPC)—that takes the CACC platoon as the control object to further use CACC technology. Secondly, an control switching method, Youla-Kučera (YK) parameterization, was adopted to ensure stability while switching the two control modes under different platoon sizes. Finally, numerical analyses and simulations were conducted to explore the effectiveness of CACPC on dynamic performance. It is found that YK parameterization can significantly suppress the perturbation caused by the switching of control mode and maintain stability during the switching.
