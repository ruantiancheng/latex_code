Urged by the potential of Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs), research has recently focused on studying their benefits on safety, emissions, and capacity. However, in most works, the CAV has been studied in isolation, and there is a lack of in-depth research on stability conditions. Therefore, this paper proposes a general representation of the heterogeneous Leader-based CAV platoon considering multiple delays. Moreover, a novel and more unconservative stability condition of the CAV platoon is derived under the general representation proposed based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii Stability Theorem and Bessel-Legendre inequalities. Furthermore, a comprehensive performance evaluation analysis of the four typical Leader-based information flow topologies (IFTs) is conducted to test tracking performance and safety conditions by numerical analyses. The results show that the CACC platoon has superior tracking performance in various scenarios if stability is guaranteed. Moreover, bi-directional communication that receives more information in most cases enables better safety condition for hard braking maneuver situations.
