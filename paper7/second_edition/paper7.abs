Urged by the potential of Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs), research has recently focused on studying their benefits on safety, emissions, and capacity. However, achieving these benefits is contingent on ensuring stability, which is the fundamental objective of CAVs. Despite the common employment of feedback control to attain stability, it cannot be guaranteed with certainty due to the inherent communication delay present in CAVs. Therefore, this paper proposes a general representation of the Leader-based CAV platoon considering multiple delays. Moreover, a novel stability condition of the CAV platoon is derived under the general representation proposed based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii Stability Theorem and Bessel-Legendre inequalities. In addition, a thorough numerical analysis is conducted in diverse scenarios to comprehensively evaluate the tracking performance and safety conditions of various control parameters and information flow topologies (IFTs). The results show that the CAV platoon has superior tracking performance in various scenarios if stability is guaranteed. Moreover, increasing the gain of the velocity error within a suitable range can moderately improve tracking performance and safety condition. Furthermore, receiving more information in most cases enables smoother tracking process.
