  abstract        = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) promise to significantly improve road traffic. To a certain extent, this situation is similar to the expectations at the end of the last century about the positive effects that the introduction of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems would have had on motorway traffic. The parallelism is interesting because ACC equipped vehicles represent the first level of vehicle automation and are now widely available on the market. In this light, studying ACC impacts can help to anticipate potential problems related to its widespread application and to avoid that AVs and CAVs will lead to the same problems. Only a few test-campaigns had been carried out studying the ACC impacts under real-world driving conditions in quantitative terms. To bridge this gap, the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission has organized a number of experimental campaigns involving several ACC-equipped vehicles to study different implications of their widespread. In this context, the present paper summarizes the outcomes of a test campaign involving 10 commercially available ACC-equipped vehicles. The test campaign has been executed in two different test-tracks of the ZalaZONE proving ground, in Hungary. The tests have been carried out at low-speeds (30–60 km/h) and have involved platoons of vehicles of different brands and different powertrains, which were tested in a variety of vehicle orders and with different settings of their ACC systems. Test results have been used to derive information about the properties of the different ACC systems, to study their string stability, to study the effect of ACC systems on traffic flow, and to draw inference about the possible implications on energy consumption and traffic safety. Results confirm the previous findings in terms of string instability of the ACC and highlight that in the present form, ACC systems will possibly lead to higher energy consumption and introduce new safety risks when their penetration in the fleet increases. However, they also highlight that the materialization of the above findings for AVs depends on the operational logic that manufacturers will adopt during the implementation phase. Therefore, results suggest that functional requirements to guarantee string stability and in general to not disrupt the normal flow of traffic should be introduced both for ACC and for any automated system that will be placed on the market in the future.},

If communication links are added, more safety and shorter gaps can be reached performing a Cooperative-ACC (CACC). Although shortening the inter-vehicular distances directly improves traffic flow, it can cause string unstable behavior. This paper presents fractional-order-based control algorithms to enhance the car-following and string stability performance for both ACC and CACC vehicle strings, including communication temporal delay effects. The proposed controller is compared with state-of-the-art implementations, exhibiting better performance. Simulation and real experiments have been conducted for validating the approach.},

  abstract        = {To fully harvest the benefits of vehicular automation and connectivity in the mixed traffic, a cooperative longitudinal control strategy named Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control with Unconnected vehicle in the loop (CACCu) has been proposed. When encountering an unconnected preceding vehicle, CACCu enables a Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) to benefit from communicating with a connected vehicle further ahead, rather than completely falling back to Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). To validate the feasibility of CACCu, this study developed and tested a CACCu system with real vehicles in the field. A speed-command-based CACCu controller is designed and parameterized for optimizing the anticipated string stability. The experiment was conducted with two automated vehicles equipped with Mobileye sensors and Wi-Fi modules. The car-following performance of CACCu, in comparison with ACC and human driving (as the ego vehicle), was evaluated in the real-traffic scenarios constructed using NGSIM vehicle trajectory data. Over the 6 test runs for each control method, it was found that CACCu reduced 10.8% acceleration Root Mean Square (RMS), 60.8% spacing error RMS and 6.2% fuel consumption from ACC's, indicating advantages of CACCu in control accuracy, ride comfort and energy efficiency. Compared with human driving, CACCu also reduced 17.6% acceleration and 13.4% fuel consumption. More importantly, the CACCu was able to efficiently avoid the traffic disturbance amplifications that frequently happened to ACC and human driving, which means the string stability has been significantly improved by the CACCu.},

This paper adds new experimental evidence to this knowledge base and presents a comprehensive empirical study on the ACC equilibrium behaviors via the resulting fundamental diagrams. We find that, like human-driven vehicles, ACC systems display a linear equilibrium spacing-speed relationship (within the range of available data) but the key parameters of these relationships can differ significantly from human-driven traffic depending on input settings. At the minimum ACC headway setting, equilibrium capacities in excess of 3500 vehicles per hour are observed, together with an extremely fast equilibrium wave speed of 100 kilometers per hour. These fast waves are unfamiliar to human drivers, and may pose a safety risk. The results also suggest that ACC jam spacing can be much larger than in human traffic, which reduces the network storage capacity.},

  abstract        = {This paper shows that the heterogeneity of drivers' and vehicles characteristics makes platoons, on average, more string-unstable. However, the string instability degree of unstable platoons is much higher in a homogeneous flow than in a heterogeneous one. These results are based on an L∞ characterization of string stability, which is shown to be the most appropriate one from a traffic safety viewpoint. Mechanisms and conditions are discussed in which an L2 characterization is not able to capture the amplification of a speed drop through a string of vehicles. An analytical sufficient condition for the L∞ string stability of heterogeneous vehicles, which move according to a general class of car-following models, is derived. Above all, a thorough comparison of L∞ and L2 string stability characterizations between a homogeneous and a heterogenous flow, is performed. To this aim, the Lp norms of heterogeneous platoons are calculated within a quasi-Monte Carlo framework. The variability of the Lp norm values due to the platoon length, the equilibrium speed, and the probability distribution model of the uncertain vehicle parameters, is analysed. Overall, it is shown that the platoon stability behaviour sensibly changes with the shape and the correlation structure of vehicle model parameter distributions. Therefore, traffic heterogeneity needs to be modelled in order to correctly characterize the string stability of a mixed traffic flow.},

  abstract        = {This paper shows that the heterogeneity of drivers' and vehicles characteristics makes platoons, on average, more string-unstable. However, the string instability degree of unstable platoons is much higher in a homogeneous flow than in a heterogeneous one. These results are based on an L∞ characterization of string stability, which is shown to be the most appropriate one from a traffic safety viewpoint. Mechanisms and conditions are discussed in which an L2 characterization is not able to capture the amplification of a speed drop through a string of vehicles. An analytical sufficient condition for the L∞ string stability of heterogeneous vehicles, which move according to a general class of car-following models, is derived. Above all, a thorough comparison of L∞ and L2 string stability characterizations between a homogeneous and a heterogenous flow, is performed. To this aim, the Lp norms of heterogeneous platoons are calculated within a quasi-Monte Carlo framework. The variability of the Lp norm values due to the platoon length, the equilibrium speed, and the probability distribution model of the uncertain vehicle parameters, is analysed. Overall, it is shown that the platoon stability behaviour sensibly changes with the shape and the correlation structure of vehicle model parameter distributions. Therefore, traffic heterogeneity needs to be modelled in order to correctly characterize the string stability of a mixed traffic flow.},

  abstract        = {Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) provides significant traffic flow improvements when a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication link exists with the preceding vehicle, but it degrades to an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) when this communication link is no longer available. This degradation occurs even if the information from another V2V-equipped vehicle ahead (different to the preceding one) is still available. This paper presents a novel car-following control system–Advanced Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (ACACC)–that benefits from the existing communication with this vehicle ahead in the string, reducing inter-vehicle gap whereas keeping string stability. The proposed control structure provides a hybrid behaviour between two CACC controllers with different time gaps according to the string position of the vehicle with the V2V communication link available. An stable hybrid behavior between both controllers is ensured through the Youla-Kucera parameterization. Simulation and real experiments show the proper behaviour of the designed control algorithm and a good performance compared to existing ACC/CACC controllers.},

  abstract        = {This paper proposes a macroscopic model to describe the operations of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) traffic flow, which is an extension of adaptive cruise control (ACC) traffic flow. In CACC traffic flow a vehicle can exchange information with many preceding vehicles through wireless communication. Due to such communication the CACC vehicle can follow its leader at a closer distance than the ACC vehicle. The stability diagrams are constructed from the developed model based on the linear and nonlinear stability method for a certain model parameter set. It is found analytically that CACC vehicles enhance the stabilization of traffic flow with respect to both small and large perturbations compared to ACC vehicles. Numerical simulation is carried out to support our analytical findings. Based on the nonlinear stability analysis, we will show analytically and numerically that the CACC system better improves the dynamic equilibrium capacity over the ACC system. We have argued that in parallel to microscopic models for CACC traffic flow, the newly developed macroscopic will provide a complete insight into the dynamics of intelligent traffic flow. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract        = {Obtaining an optimal stability condition is very important to benefit traffic flow operations for a mix of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and regular vehicles. In view of multiple spatial anticipations of CAV car-following models, this paper presents a stability analysis method for mixed CAV flow from the perspective of the uniform local platoon. Transfer function theory was used to derive the stability criterion of the uniform local platoon, based on which a stability chart of equilibrium speeds and CAV feedback coefficients was calculated. Numerical simulations were also performed on a segment of highway with an on-ramp using car-following models to evaluate the impacts of the stability analysis on fuel consumption and emissions [carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxides (NOX)]. The stability chart indicates that by controlling CAV feedback coefficients, the optimal stability condition can be obtained, in which the uniform local platoon remains stable for all driving speeds. Moreover, the stability analysis method can reduce fuel consumption and traffic emissions. DOI: 10.1061/JTEPBS.0000196. {\textcopyright} 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

  abstract        = {Adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles are proving to be the first generation of automated vehicles. Although many studies have found that, theoretically, ACC vehicles may have positive impacts on traffic string stability and throughput, recent studies reveal that commercially-available ACC vehicles are string unstable. However, it is still not clear what impacts on highway traffic these commercially-available ACC vehicles may have at higher market penetration rates. Therefore, the objective of this study is twofold: (i) investigate the impacts on highway traffic capacity of mixed human-piloted vehicles and theoretical ACC vehicles as well as commercially-available ACC vehicles at different market penetration rates; (ii) explore the potential relationship between string stability and highway throughput. We use the intelligent driver model with calibrated parameter values from car following data collected on commercially-available ACC vehicles and compare the simulation results to simulations conducted using a theoretical ACC vehicle model with parameter values obtained in the literature. The results show that when simulating ACC vehicles found in the literature,traffic flow is string stable and the bottleneck capacity increases by up to 7% at higher market penetration rates as compared to homogeneous human driven traffic. When commercially-available ACC vehicles are simulated, the traffic flow is string unstable and the bottleneck capacity decreases at higher market penetration rates with some scenarios resulting in a decrease in capacity of up to 35%. The analysis provides evidence that bottleneck capacity is substantially affected by string stability and inter-vehicle time gap, while downstream throughput is solely influenced by time gap.},

  abstract        = {Emergent cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) strategies being proposed for platoon formation in the connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) context mostly assume idealized fixed information flow topologies (IFTs) for the platoon, implying guaranteed vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications for the IFT assumed. In reality, V2V communications are unreliable due to failures resulting from communication-related constraints such as interference and information congestion. Since CACC strategies entail continuous information broadcasting, communication failures can occur in congested CAV traffic networks, leading to a platoon's IFT varying dynamically. To explicitly factor IFT dynamics and to leverage it to enhance the performance of CACC strategies, this study proposes the idea of dynamically optimizing the IFT for CACC, labeled the CACC-OIFT strategy. Under CACC-OIFT, the vehicles in the platoon cooperatively determine in real-time which vehicles will dynamically deactivate or activate the “send” functionality of their V2V communication devices to generate IFTs that optimize the platoon performance in terms of string stability under the ambient traffic conditions. The CACC-OIFT consists of an IFT optimization model and an adaptive Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller. Given the adaptive PD controller with a two-predecessor-following scheme, and the ambient traffic conditions and the platoon size just before the start of a time period, the IFT optimization model determines the optimal IFT that maximizes the expected string stability in terms of the energy of speed oscillations. This expectation is because each IFT has specific degeneration scenarios whose probabilities are determined by the communication failure probabilities for that time period based on the ambient traffic conditions. The optimal IFT is deployed for that time period, and the adaptive PD controller continuously determines the car-following behaviors of the vehicles based on the unfolding degeneration scenario for each time instant within that period. The effectiveness of the proposed CACC-OIFT is validated through numerical experiments in NS-3 based on NGSIM field data. The results indicate that the proposed CACC-OIFT can significantly enhance the string stability of platoon control in an unreliable V2V communication context, outperforming CACCs with fixed IFTs or with passive adaptive schemes for IFT dynamics.},

  abstract        = {Literature has shown potentials of Connected/Cooperative Automated Vehicles (CAVs) in improving highway operations, especially on roadway capacity and flow stability. However, benefits were also shown to be negligible at low market penetration rates. This work develops a novel adaptive driving strategy for CAVs to stabilise heterogeneous vehicle strings by controlling one CAV under vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. Assumed is a roadside system with V2I communications, which receives control parameters of the CAV in the string and estimates parameters imperfectly of non-connected automated vehicles. It determines the adaptive control parameters (e.g. desired time gap and feedback gains) of the CAV if a downstream disturbance is identified and sends them to the CAV. The CAV changes its behaviour based on the adaptive parameters commanded by the roadside system to suppress the disturbance. The proposed adaptive driving strategy is based on string stability analysis of heterogeneous vehicle strings. To this end, linearised vehicle dynamics model and control law are used in the controller parametrisation and Laplace transform of the speed and gap error dynamics in time domain to frequency domain enables the determination of sufficient string stability criteria of heterogeneous strings. The analytical string stability conditions give new insights into automated vehicular string stability properties in relation to the system properties of time delays and controller design parameters of feedback gains and desired time gap. It further allows the quantification of a stability margin, which is subsequently used to adapt the feedback control gains and desired time gap of the CAV to suppress the amplification of gap and speed errors through the string. Analytical results are verified via systematic simulation of both homogeneous and heterogeneous strings. Simulation demonstrates the predictive power of the analytical string stability conditions. The performance of the adaptive driving strategy under V2I cooperation is tested in simulation. Results show that even the estimation of control parameters of non-connected automated vehicles are imperfect and there is mismatch between the model used in analytical derivation and that in simulation, the proposed adaptive driving strategy suppresses disturbances in a wide range of situations.},

The proposed control law based on the sliding-mode controller can guarantee both homogeneous and heterogeneous string stability, if the control parameters and system parameters meet certain requirements. The analysis of the negative effect of the parasitic time delays and lags on the string stability indicates that the negative effect of the time delays is larger than that of the time lags. This paper provides a practical means to evaluate the ACC systems applying the sliding-mode controller and provides a reasonable proposal to design the ACC controller from the perspective of the practical string stability. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

To materialize these widely expected potentials of AVs, a sound understanding of AVs' impacts on traffic flow is essential. Not surprisingly, despite the relatively short history of AVs, there have been numerous studies in the literature focusing on understanding and modeling various aspects of AV-involved traffic flow and significant progresses have already been made. To understand the recent development and ultimately inspire new research ideas on this important topic, this survey systematically and comprehensively reviews the existing AV-involved traffic flow models with different levels of details, and examines the relationship among the design of AV-based driving strategies, the management of transportation systems, and the resulting traffic dynamics. The pros and cons of the existing models and approaches are critically discussed, and future research directions are also provided.},

  abstract        = {As Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) gradually occupy more market share, the mixed traffic flow composed of MVs and CAVs will exist for a long time. This paper mainly explores the impact of CAV platoon management and control mode degradation on the fundamental diagram, and further studies how they affect fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. First, in terms of platoon management, the mixed traffic flow configurations and distribution characteristics of four types of vehicles were proposed. Second, numerical analyses were conducted, and a fundamental diagram considering CAV platoons and degradation of the Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) system was proposed. To validate this fundamental diagram, the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) and the Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) and CACC models proposed by the PATH lab were applied for simulations. Third, the influence of CAV platoons on the traffic environment was explored via micro simulations as well. Conclusions were drawn from the results of the simulations: The mixed traffic can obtain significant capacity gain due to the existence of CAV platoons, especially with high Market Penetration Rate (MPR). Moreover, capacity break-downs occurred in the diagram due to the adjustment of information flow topology, and the break-downs were more prominent with higher MPR. Additionally, CAV platoons can significantly reduce fuel consumption and emissions by 34.7% and 41.4% respectively. The first degradation raises fuel consumption and emissions by 44.5% and 60.1%, while the second one by 12.0% and 16.1%, with the initial vehicle speed set at 33 m/s and MPR set at 1.0. Finally, according to the sensitivity analysis, an optimal platoon size of 5 vehicles was suggested for CAV platoon management.},

The proposed control is designed as a decentralized linear feedback and feedforward controller with a focus on robust local and string stability under (i) time-varying uncertain vehicle dynamics and (ii) time-varying uncertain communication delay. The former uncertainty is incorporated into the general longitudinal vehicle dynamics (GLVD) equation that regulates the difference between the desired acceleration (prescribed by the control model) and the actual acceleration by compensating for nonlinear vehicle dynamics (e.g., due to aerodynamic drag force). The latter uncertainty is incorporated into acceleration information received from the vehicle immediately ahead. As a primary contribution, this study derives and proves (i) a sufficient and necessary condition for local stability and (ii) sufficient conditions for robust string stability in the frequency domain using the Laplacian transformation. Simulation experiments verify the correctness of the mathematical proofs and demonstrate that the proposed control is effective for ensuring stability against uncertainties.},

  abstract        = {This paper presents a rolling horizon stochastic optimal control strategy for both Adaptive Cruise Control and Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control under uncertainty based on the constant time gap policy. Specifically, uncertainties that can arise in vehicle control systems and vehicle sensor measurements are represented as normally-distributed disturbances to state and measurement equations in a state-space formulation. Then, acceleration sequence of a controlled vehicle is determined by optimizing an objective function that captures control efficiency and driving comfort over a predictive horizon, constrained by bounded acceleration/deceleration and collision protection. The optimization problem is formulated as a linearly constrained linear quadratic Gaussian problem and solved using a separation principle, Lagrangian relaxation, and Kalman filter. A sensitivity analysis and a scenario-based analysis via simulations demonstrate that the proposed control strategy can generate smoother vehicle control and perform better than a deterministic feedback controller, particularly under small system disturbances and large measurement disturbances.},
