Literature has shown the potential of Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) in improving capacity, safety, and pollutant emission.  These benefits are preconditioned to meeting stability, which is the primary goal of CAV. However, the widely used feedback control cannot guarantee stability due to the inevitable delays. Therefore, extensive research has been conducted to derive stability criteria considering delays. However, limited by the fitting model of engine dynamics, only the effect of communication delay is considered. In fact, the internal delay also significantly affects engine dynamics, where considering internal delay can significantly improve the model fit. Moreover, the methodology of stability criterion considering multiple time delays needs to be proposed. Therefore, this paper first proposes a general supermatrix representation of the CAV platoon considering multiple delays to address this issue. In addition, a novel stability criterion of the general CAV platoon considering multiple delays is derived based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii Stability Theorem and free-weighting matrix. Moreover, considering system uncertainties, another stability criterion that considers time-varying structured uncertainties is also derived. Furthermore, extensive numerical simulations are conducted in multiple scenarios to verify the effects of multiple delays, uncertainties, and control parameters on tracking performance and safety conditions. The results indicate that all CAVs under each case can track errors and return to equilibrium if the stability criteria are satisfied. Besides, the introduction of time-varying structured uncertainties and the internal communication delay worsens the tracking performance, where uncertainties lead to more significant overshoot and recovering time, while the internal communication delay makes CAV unable to perform the desired time headway. Moreover, introducing uncertainties similarly worsens the safety condition, making collision-prone scenarios more probable. Further, from the point of view of control parameters, increasing the gain of spacing and velocity errors can benefit tracking performance, while increasing the gain of acceleration errors does not.
